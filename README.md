# Two-Sum Problem Project

This project implements a solution to the **Two-Sum Problem**, a fundamental challenge in data structures and algorithms (DSA). The goal is to identify two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target value and return their indices.

## Why This Problem is Important for DSA

The Two-Sum Problem is a classic example of:

1. **Algorithmic Thinking**: It teaches how to break down a problem into smaller steps using loops and conditions.
2. **Time Complexity Analysis**: Understanding how different approaches (e.g., nested loops vs. hash maps) impact the efficiency of a solution.
3. **Core DSA Concepts**: It introduces the use of arrays/lists, loops, and conditional logic, which are foundational for solving complex problems.

By learning and implementing this problem, you develop a deeper understanding of how algorithms work and how to optimize them for better performance.

## Why You Need to Understand This to Be a Software Engineer (SWE)

As a Software Engineer:

- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Many real-world problems involve finding relationships or patterns in data, similar to the Two-Sum Problem.
- **Interview Preparation**: The Two-Sum Problem is commonly asked in technical interviews to evaluate problem-solving abilities.
- **Efficiency in Code**: Writing optimal solutions demonstrates your understanding of algorithmic complexity and resource management.
- **Building Scalable Systems**: Concepts like searching and pairing are critical when working on databases, APIs, and other system components.

## How the Code Works

1. **Function Definition**:

   - The `find_two_sum` function is the core logic. It takes two inputs:
     - `numbers` (a list of integers)
     - `target` (an integer target value)
   - It loops through all pairs of numbers to find the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:

   - Nested loops compare each number with every number that comes after it.
   - If the sum of the two numbers matches the target, their indices are returned.
   - If no such pair is found, an empty list is returned.

3. **Testing**:
   - The code is tested with sample inputs to ensure it works as expected.

## Sample Input and Output

### Input

```python
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9


```

[0, 1] # Indices of numbers that add up to the target

## Key Learning Outcomes

- **Loops**: Understanding how to iterate over lists to find patterns.
- **Conditionals**: Learning to use `if` statements to filter data.
- **Data Structures**: Practicing with lists and how to access their elements by index.
- **Returning Results**: Using Python's `return` statement to output the solution.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository or create a new Python file.
2. Copy the code into your file.
3. Run the program in your Python environment with test inputs.
4. Observe the output to ensure correctness.

## Next Steps

To further enhance your skills, consider:

### Optimizing the Solution:

- Implement a hash map to reduce the time complexity to O(n).

### Expanding Functionality:

- Handle cases where multiple pairs add up to the target.
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.

### Advanced Applications:

- Solve variations of the problem, like the Three-Sum Problem.
